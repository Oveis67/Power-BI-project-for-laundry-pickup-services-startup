Here you can see another finalization project using Power BI working for a laundry pickup services startup called We Wash You Sleep. This is a relatively small company, and they cannot compete with the big players in major cities. The company's strategy is to build a vast network in the smaller cities. 
We already had a strong presence in 140 locations in USA and recently opened stores in ten new cities. Additionally, the company has two separate sales regions, so that's just some additional information. On top of everything else, you have been assigned to analytics tasks.
Now I tried to Identify which of the two sales regions is performing better using specific dataset outperforms the other in two of the three metrics: Average revenue per state, Average marketing spent per state (less is better), Average Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) per state (revenue/marketingspent)
In the next step, I have focused on which of the ten new cities that have the best potential for the company to invest more funds into marketing and finally published the Power BI report.
